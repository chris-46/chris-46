## :milky_way: Hello, dear Visitor! :alien: :wave:	##
Whether it's from university or a personal project, I give my all in these projects and I'm glad you're here today!   

:popcorn: For your Viewing Pleasure  :film_projector: : Each project should have a **README** file that will give you a **brief overview** of each project and **what I've learned** in doing the project along with relevant **code snippets** :page_facing_up:.

### :paperclip: More about me: 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning **DevOps** and **CI/CD** skills like using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS** as that's the field I aspire to eventually work in.
- :hammer: I'm also planning to do a **full-stack web development** project in **JavaScript** using **React** and **HTML/CSS** with an integrated **PostgreSQL database**.
- :scroll: Iâ€™m currently working on **earning certifications** for the skills mentioned above, hopefully learning everything I need to do well in the field!

### :star2: Thanks for checking out my repository! :blush:
