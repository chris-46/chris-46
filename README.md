### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## This is where I keep most of my projects! Whether it's from university or personal, I give my all in these projects and I'm glad you're here today!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **DevOps** and **CI/CD** skills like using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS** as that's the field I aspire to eventually work in.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on earning certifications for the skills mentioned above, hopefully learning everything I need to do well in the field!
