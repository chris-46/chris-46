## :milky_way: Hello, dear Visitor! :alien: :wave:	##
I'm Chris, a software engineer with a combined 2 years of experience in agile **Object-Oriented Development**, **Test Engineering**, **Build Engineering/DevOps**, and **MERN web development**. As a passionate problem solver with an eye for detail, I am dedicated to enhancing and optimizing every project I work on, always striving to leave things better than I found them.

This is my personal repository that outlines how I've impreoved as a developer. Whether it's from university or a personal project, I give my all in these projects and I'm glad you're here to see them today!
### :popcorn: For your Viewing Pleasure :film_projector:
Each project should have a **README** file that will give you a **brief overview** of each project and **what I've learned** in doing the project along with relevant **code snippets** :page_facing_up:.

### :paperclip: More about me: 
- :hammer: I'm working on a **full-stack web development** AI Itinerary Project with **ReactJS**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

- ü§ñ I‚Äôm fascinated with the world of AI, and I'm starting a **Python** project that uses **Pydantic** and **Langchain** to do some pretty cool stuff!.

- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next, I'd like to level up my **Build Engineering/DevOps** by working with **CI/CD** tools like **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, and **AWS**.
  - The goal is to make a project where I can host all my past projects to demo, and I can publish changes that that will be pushed on the demo.

- :scroll: I‚Äôm currently working on **earning certifications** for the skills mentioned above, hopefully learning everything I need to do well in the field!

### :star2: Thanks for checking out my repository! :blush:
